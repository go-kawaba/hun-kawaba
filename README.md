# hun kawaba

A Discord bot for various *kawaba* utilities.

*kawaba* is an a priori, oligosynthetic, and most importantly, fun language! kawaba constructs words using only 160 single syllable roots. These roots are derived from semantic primes and molecules, fundamental concepts that are common to all languages.
